Premise Info should have a seperate view - Reason, once an agents log in, and fill in the premise information
Other thing will be to just fill in patient info and drug information
So patient info and drug information belongs to the same view

PatientID is auto-generated - so you will tell the person filling the form to omit or don't put it in the first place
